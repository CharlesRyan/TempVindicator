# TempVindicator
Remote Telemetry Unit (RTU) software for an Arduino Uno equipped with two temperature sensors (one inside, one outside housing), ethernet port, real time clock, lcd display, and five-key keypad to cycle on-screen information, and two RGB LED lights.

This RTU samples internal and ambient temperature, responding to queries over DCP from a master unit. Possible responses include current temperature and timestamped highest/lowest temperature over last 24 hours
